when you register initially you do not have any roles

when you have no roles
    you have a button for creating your own course and you will become a director of that course so a role director for that course will be applied to your account.        
    you have invitations folder in which your invitations go when someone send you one and you have a button accept and a button delete
     

when you have a role director 
    you have a search bar which searches all users in the app (search can be by username, email or name with search by option)
    you can send invitation requests to people for administrator role
    you can create groups
    you can send invitation requests to people for lector role and you select the groups from dropdown menu
    you can send invitation requests to people for student role and you select the groups from dropdown menu
    you can see list with people and the roles they have in your school,
    you can edit their roles, completely delete the person's role and kick him out of the course in a way, send text messages, change the groups background images


when you have a role administrator
    you can do all the things that the director can except for inviting new administrators and editing the roles of the existing ones


when you have a role Lector 
    you can change the profile picture of the group
    you can invite students again with the help of dropdown menu for groups selection if you want to add them in several groups
    you can remove students
    you can schedule a test (no other role can do that)
    you have folders with questions that you can combine however you want (folder in folder in folder, other folder, 2 questions)
    when you create test you select folder and question count to be randomly taken from this folder and you do this until you are satisfied
    when the test is successfully created, you select the groups to which it will be scheduled you select start time and end time
    when test is scheduled all online students should receive a message in their inbox folder(like a notification)
    once a test is scheduled you can edit the start time and the end time and delete the test
    you can see all your students past exams in the group (what the questions happen to be what the student selected, what is the right answer and how many points does he have)
    you can add new chats (text chats)

when you have a role student
    you can do a test
    you can see your past tests (results, correct answers and selected answers)
    you can vote to polls


if you have role other than director you will have inbox folder in which you will receive some important messages like if someone change your role in some course or if he completely delete you from it or maybe a new exam has been scheduled if you are a student. You will have a button ok to the right of the message and that is the only way it can be deleted, but make it so the app recognizes which messages are seen and which are not and maybe put something red in front of the new ones.

every group will have chats and it will have 3 chats out of the box (#general #random #polls)

every user can send text messages to other users for example an admin can send a message to a student saying "Your profile picture is inappropirate, please change it or you will have to leave" (if the student is online when the message is sent he should receive a notification or popup or something)

as much stuff in the app should be real time
